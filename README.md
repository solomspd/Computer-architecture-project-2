This project is a simulation for the Tomasulo algorithm with speculation. It includes the ROB, Parser, Reservation Station, Memory, and the Tomasulo class. We implemented this code using c++.

This working simulation includes all the Ridiculously Simple Computer (RiSC-16) instructions.

The simulator simulates the programâ€™s execution on a dual-issue processor. The parser is implemented as required in the bonus section. Also, the variable hardware orginization is implemented entailing the variable numbers of issues ROB size, number of resevations stations, and the number of cycles for each station.
